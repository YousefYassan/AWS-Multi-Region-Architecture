![Blank_diagram_-_Page_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3f4b0a1-911b-41db-9442-8cdbae30fcd6)

## Project Overview

This project implements a robust, highly available, and disaster-resistant AWS infrastructure spanning multiple regions (Ohio and Stockholm). The architecture enables geographical redundancy, ensuring business continuity through regional failures while maintaining optimal performance for global users.

## Architecture Components

### Multi-Region Setup
- **Primary Regions**: US East (Ohio) and Europe (Stockholm)
- **Availability Zones**: Each region utilizes multiple Availability Zones (A and B) for high availability

### Networking

#### VPC Architecture
- **VPC CIDR**: 10.0.0.0/16 in both regions
- **Subnet Structure**:
  - Public Subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24): For internet-facing resources
  - Private Subnets 1 (10.0.3.0/24): For application resources
  - Private Subnets 2 (10.0.4.0/24, 10.0.5.0/24): For database resources

#### Connectivity
- **Internet Gateways**: Providing internet access to the public subnets
- **NAT Gateways**: Enabling outbound internet connectivity for private subnets
- **Transit Gateway**: Facilitating inter-region connectivity
- **Transit Gateway Attachments**: Connecting resources across regions

### Computing Resources

#### EC2 Instances
- **Bastion Hosts**: Deployed in public subnets for secure SSH access
- **Application Instances**: Running in private subnets with appropriate security controls

#### Auto Scaling
- **Auto Scaling Groups**: Implemented for application tier to handle variable loads
- **Load Balancers**: Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) distributing traffic across instances

### Database Layer

#### Aurora Database
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Aurora clusters spanning multiple Availability Zones
- **Primary-Secondary Setup**: Primary in one AZ with read replicas in another
- **Synchronous Replication**: Ensuring data consistency across database instances

## High Availability Features

### Regional Redundancy
- Complete infrastructure mirrored across two geographic regions
- Transit Gateway enabling seamless failover between regions

### Zonal Redundancy
- Resources distributed across multiple Availability Zones within each region
- Automatic failover capabilities for critical services

### Load Balancing
- ELB instances in both public and private subnets
- Health checks ensuring traffic is routed only to healthy instances

## Disaster Recovery Strategy

### Active-Active Configuration
- Both regions actively serving traffic with the ability to handle full load if needed
- DNS-based routing directing users to the nearest healthy region

### Data Synchronization
- Synchronous replication for database tier ensuring up-to-date data across regions
- Automated backup and restore procedures

## Security Measures

### Network Security
- Public and private subnet segregation following AWS best practices
- Security Groups and Network ACLs controlling traffic flow

### Access Management
- Bastion hosts as the only entry point for administrative access
- IAM roles and policies implementing principle of least privilege

## Monitoring and Management

### CloudWatch Integration
- Comprehensive monitoring of all AWS resources
- Customized dashboards and alarms for critical metrics

### Infrastructure as Code
- Complete infrastructure defined using AWS CloudFormation or Terraform
- Version-controlled infrastructure enabling consistent deployments

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Efficiency
- Auto Scaling ensuring optimal resource utilization
- Reserved Instances for predictable workloads

### Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region Considerations
- Critical components deployed across regions
- Less critical components using multi-AZ within a single region for cost efficiency

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured with necessary access
- Infrastructure as Code tools (CloudFormation or Terraform)

### Deployment Steps
1. VPC and networking infrastructure deployment
2. Security groups and IAM roles configuration
3. Transit Gateway and attachments setup
4. Compute resources deployment
5. Database tier implementation
6. Load balancer and auto-scaling configuration
7. Monitoring and alerting setup

## Testing Procedures

### Availability Testing
- Simulated AZ failure recovery
- Simulated region failure recovery

### Performance Testing
- Cross-region latency measurements
- Load testing under various traffic conditions

## Future Enhancements

- Implementation of AWS Global Accelerator for improved global routing
- Enhanced security with AWS Shield and WAF integration
- Additional read replicas for improved database performance
- Integration with AWS Backup for centralized backup management
